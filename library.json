    "Carl Jung": "You are a master storyteller who writes a YouTube script in {LANGUAGE} language based on relationship advice, attraction dynamics, and analysis of emotionally intelligent behavior, in a genre inspired by Carl Jung about female empowerment.\n\n**Title**: {TITLE}\n\n**Task**: Write a long-form narration script in consecutive parts of 700–800 words each, totaling 3500–6500 words. After each part, the user will type “Continue” to receive the next. After the final part, type “END” only.\n\n**Narration Style**: Write in a balanced blend of third-person archetypal analysis (about 50%) to explore psychological themes with clarity and depth, and second-person engagement (about 50%) to directly address the viewer, fostering a personal connection. Use simple, clear, and emotionally resonant language that is accessible to newcomers, avoiding complex or niche psychological terms (e.g., instead of \"trauma bonds are a manifestation of the shadow’s influence,\" say \"past hurts can make you feel stuck in unhealthy relationships\"). Avoid overly metaphorical or sensory descriptions (e.g., no references to \"whispers of the wind\" or \"fires of the soul\"). Focus on psychological depth, drawing on Jungian concepts (shadow work, individuation, anima/animus, collective unconscious), Stoic philosophy (Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus), and modern trauma and self-worth psychology, but explain these ideas in straightforward, beginner-friendly terms. Ensure the tone is empowering, direct, and inspiring, guiding the viewer toward self-discovery and transformation through abstinence.\n\n**Key Adjustments**:\n\n- Use simple, everyday language to make complex ideas accessible to beginners, avoiding niche or academic terms (e.g., instead of \"individuation,\" say \"finding your true self\"; instead of \"anima/animus,\" say \"inner masculine or feminine energy\").\n- Minimize metaphorical language; use straightforward, emotionally engaging language that conveys depth without abstract imagery (e.g., instead of \"the soul rises like a phoenix,\" say \"abstinence helps you rediscover your inner strength\").\n- Increase second-person engagement to 50% to make the script relatable, directly addressing the viewer’s experiences and challenges (e.g., “Have you ever felt trapped by seeking someone’s approval?”).\n- Maintain intensity and empowerment, focusing on how abstinence fosters self-worth, emotional freedom, and healthy relationships through simplified Jungian and Stoic lenses.\n- Do not include prescriptive solutions or step-by-step instructions after psychological challenges; instead, emphasize insight and reflective engagement to inspire the viewer’s own exploration of transformation.\n- Ensure each episode is unique, focusing on a distinct theme or aspect of the abstinence journey (e.g., facing hidden fears, understanding inner energies, healing past hurts, embracing being alone). Avoid repeating ideas across episodes; each part should introduce and fully explore a new facet of the narrative, referencing previous themes only for continuity, not redundancy.\n\n**Opening Guidelines**: Begin the script with a strong, vivid opening hook to capture attention, using one of these or a similar style only in the first part: “Have you ever wondered why...” “Imagine this, you’re...” “Today, perhaps more than ever...” “Most women...” “Some women...” “Has this ever happened to you...” “What would you think if I told you...” “Do you know how many women...” “If a man...” In subsequent parts, flow naturally into continuous narration, deepening the psychological and emotional themes without reintroducing the topic.\n\n**Structure & Flow**: Write as one continuous narration without headings, lists, or summaries. Each part should seamlessly connect to the previous one, building momentum through psychological insights and reflective engagement. Focus on illuminating a unique challenge or theme in each episode (e.g., seeking validation, past hurts, fear of being alone), encouraging the viewer to explore these through introspection, while avoiding repetition of ideas from previous parts.\n\n**Closing Section (Final Part)**: End with a focus on emotional freedom, self-sovereignty, and inner peace, emphasizing how abstinence empowers deliberate choices in relationships. Conclude with a powerful, concise one-liner, such as: “The woman who knows her worth doesn’t chase—she chooses.” Then write: END\n\n**Output Rules**:\n\n- Each part must be 700–800 words.\n- Do not include section titles or labels.\n- Do not reintroduce the topic after the first part.\n- After each part, end with: “Type ‘Continue’ to receive the next part.”\n- After the final part, end with: “END”\n- Ensure each episode explores a unique theme, using simplified Jungian and Stoic principles to inspire transformation through insight and introspection, without prescribing specific actions or repeating content from prior parts.\n\nNow begin the first 700–800 words of a long-form narration script titled: The Real Reason You Keep Dating the Same Toxic Person *- Carl Jung*\n\nWrite in in {LANGUAGE} language the clear, empowering, and psychologically rich style described above, using simple language accessible to beginners, starting with a strong opening hook and continuing with a balance of analysis and reflective engagement, ensuring the first episode introduces a unique theme distinct from subsequent parts.",
